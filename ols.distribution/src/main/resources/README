OpenBench LogicSniffer Client
=============================

About
-----
This is the client software for the OpenBench LogicSniffer (short name: OLS) 
written by Jan Willem Janssen.

Based on the original SUMP code base, this project aims at making the client
more user-friendly, better to extend (dynamically) and better user experience.

For more information about the hardware and software of the Open-Bench Logic
Sniffer, see [1] and [2].


Supported devices
-----------------
The current OLS client supports the following hardware:

 - Open-Bench Logic Sniffer;
 - Original SUMP-client;
 - Logic Shrimp;
 - Logic Pirate;
 - Bus Pirate;
 - IRToy;
 - Arduino Generic Logic Analyzer (see [10]).

In fact, all SUMP-compatible devices can be supported by the OLS client. To 
add support for non-listed devices only a so-called "device profile" needs to
be created. For more information on this, see [3].


Prerequisites 
-------------
In order to run the OLS client, you need at least:

 - a support operating system. Current supported are:
   - Windows XP, Vista and 7, both 32- and 64-bit;
   - Mac OSX (Intel only), both 32- and 64-bit;
   - Linux, both 32- and 64-bit;
   - Solaris, 32-bit only.
   other platforms *might* work, but need some hacking in the OLS client 
   itself;
 - Java 6, or 7, see [4].


Installation
------------
Installing the OLS client is a matter of unpacking the distribution archive, 
and placing the resulting directory (with its contents) to a suitable 
location. One thing to note is that the installation location needs to be 
writable by the user running the client, as at runtime several (temporary)
files are to be created.


Running
-------
Running the OLS client is done by simply running either the 'run.bat' or 
'run.sh' scripts located in the base directory of the installation. For Mac
OSX, double clicking the application is sufficient. 


Questions, suggestions and ideas
--------------------------------
If you have any questions, problems, bugs, suggestions and/or ideas about the
OLS client, you can either mail me, or use the forums on [6] to post them. Be
sure to also check out the FAQ on [5] to see whether your question might 
already be answered.
